# NewerDanceConverter
Converts back and forth NewerSMBW credit dance binary files into text files

# Disclaimer
This was made using the Newer Team's credit dance converting script, which can be found [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673706851422044211/921115863468367892/Sequence.py) (Thanks to [Meatball132](https://github.com/Meatball132) for sending it)

Most of the code here looks like a blatant copy-paste of this script and it is meant to be: it's a port of it but with a reversing ability

# Where to find my game's Dance.bin file to edit?
It's in NewerSMBW's CreditBG.arc.LZ file, which can be found in the SpriteTex folder of the riivolution patch of the game, or in the Object folder if you're using an extracted rom.

The CreditBG.arc.LZ may be named CreditBG.arc.LH if you use a NewerSMBW version below v1.3.0, but either way you'll need to decompress it into a regular .arc file, and the, open it with [BrawlBox](https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools/releases), [BrawlCrate](https://github.com/soopercool101/BrawlCrate/releases) or SZS Explorer (found in the [CTools](http://www.chadsoft.co.uk/ctools/setup/ctoolssetup.msi) pack) and then extracting Dance.bin
